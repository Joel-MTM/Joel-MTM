It's incredible how just a few lines of code are enough to simplify many tasks that would otherwise 
take us hours or even days to complete. The reality is that we live in a world where software makes 
our lives much easier and is present in everything around us. My name is Joel Manuel Trabuco Machado,
I'm 22 years old, and I currently work in IT and software development for the company I work for. I 
have a degree in management and programming of computer systems, but I admit that a large part of my 
knowledge was acquired in a self-taught manner and through accumulated experience over time.
  
One of the qualities I value most in myself is the constant desire to always learn more in every 
area I encounter. I love a good challenge and feel fulfilled when solving problems that, for many, 
seem to have no solution. I believe that nothing is impossible... we just haven't discovered how to 
get there yet.
